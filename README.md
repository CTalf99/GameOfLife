# GameOfLife
A small program to imitate Conway's game of life: 
Cells live on to the next round of they have 2 or 3 living neigbours. 
Dead cells come alive if they have 3 living neigbhours.

Live cells are represented by an asterisk, dead cells are represented by a '.' 
The seed is hard coded with as a horizontal line of living cells across the centre of the grid.
The game progresses automatically, with the grid being updated and displayed every 2 seconds.
